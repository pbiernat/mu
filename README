mu is a small application meant to fix FF5 SRAM checksums. FF5 performs a quick
check of data, then compares it to offset 0x1FF0 (of the SRAM), this is to
prevent the game from running corrupted data. 

However, if you wish to modify the SRAM for use in ultra-precise emulators (or
real hardware), you will cause the game's check to fail. mu calculates the new
(correct) checksum and places it at 0x1FF0, allowing the game to continue.

--Usage--
$:./mu.bin <ff5.srm>

------------------->
BE CAREFUL. There are currently no checks in place to ensure that the file you
provide is actually FF5 SRAM. If you have read/write permissions, the 
program will go on and happily overwrite whatever happens to be at 0x1FF0.
